# Payroll and Benefits Calculations

## Salary Structure

Base salaries are calculated using the following formula:
- **Monthly salary = Annual salary ÷ 12**
- **Bi-weekly salary = Annual salary ÷ 26**
- **Hourly rate (for non-exempt) = Annual salary ÷ 2080 hours**

## Relocation Allowance Calculation

The relocation allowance is $5,000. Here are some example calculations:

**Scenario 1:** If you spend $2,000 on moving company fees and $1,500 on temporary housing:
- Total spent: $2,000 + $1,500 = $3,500
- Remaining allowance: $5,000 - $3,500 = $1,500

**Scenario 2:** If your move date shifts by 12 days and the lump sum hits your account 5 business days after banking info is filed, you should file 8 business days before your move date to have funds 3 days before the move.

**Scenario 3:** Payment processing timeline:
- Banking info submitted: Day 0
- Processing time: 5 business days
- Payment deposited: Day 5
- To have funds 3 days before move: Submit 8 business days before move date

## Tax Calculations

The relocation allowance may be taxable. Example:
- Gross allowance: $5,000
- If taxable at 25% rate: Tax = $5,000 × 0.25 = $1,250
- Net allowance: $5,000 - $1,250 = $3,750

## Overtime Calculations

For non-exempt employees:
- Regular hourly rate: Base annual salary ÷ 2080
- Overtime rate (over 40 hours/week): Regular rate × 1.5
- Example: If regular rate is $25/hour, overtime is $25 × 1.5 = $37.50/hour

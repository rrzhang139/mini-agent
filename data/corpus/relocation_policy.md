# Employee Relocation Policy

## Relocation Allowance

All employees relocating for work are eligible for a **$5,000 relocation allowance**. This is a one-time payment that covers miscellaneous expenses related to your move.

## Eligible Expenses

The $5,000 relocation allowance can be used for:
- Moving company fees
- Temporary housing (up to 30 days)
- Transportation costs (airfare, gas, car rental)
- Storage fees (up to 90 days)
- Setup fees for utilities
- Miscellaneous moving supplies

## Banking Information

To receive your relocation allowance:
1. Submit your banking information through the HR portal
2. Allow 5 business days for processing
3. The lump sum payment will be deposited directly to your account

**Example calculation:** If you submit banking info on a Monday, payment processing takes 5 business days. So Monday + 5 business days = the following Monday (assuming no holidays). The payment will be deposited 3 days before your move date if you submit 8 business days in advance.

## Important Notes

- The relocation allowance must be claimed within 90 days of your official start date
- Keep all receipts for tax purposes (the allowance may be taxable income)
- Contact HR if you have questions about eligibility
